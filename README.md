Dockerized Jepsen
=================

This docker image attempts to simplify the setup required by Jepsen.
It is intended to be used by a CI tool or anyone with docker who wants to try jepsen themselves.

It contains all the jepsen dependencies and code. It uses [docker-in-docker](https://github.com/jpetazzo/dind) to spin up the five
containers used by Jepsen.  

To start run (note the required --privileged flag)
Got my own with the jepsen latest from gator1, me!

````
    docker run --privileged -t -i gators/jepsen
````

Building the docker image
=========================

Alternatively, you can build the image yourself. This is a multi-step process, mainly because [docker doesn't let you build with --privileged operations](https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/1916)

1.  From this directory run 

    ````
	docker build -t jepsen .
    ````

2.  Start the container and run build-dockerized-jepsen.sh

    ````
    docker run --privileged -t -i jepsen

    > build-dockerized-jepsen.sh
    ````

3.  From another window commit the updated image

    ````
    docker commit {above container-id} jepsen
    ````
    
4.  With the final image created, you can create a container to run Jepsen from

    ```
    docker run --privileged -t -i jepsen
    ```

Run tmux in the docker image to get multiple Windows
=========================

    install tmux in the image for multiple terminals (kind of)
    sudo apt-get install tmux

    issue:
    tmux

    then resize your window to be double width.

    Then:

    CTRL+b, %

    Then you can use:
    CTRL+b, <- and -> 

    (Left arrow and right arrow)

    to switch windows. 

Upload image to docker hub so that it can be used as gators/jepsen
=========================

    Tag and push the image
    If you don’t already have a terminal open, open one now:

    Go back to your command line terminal.
    At the prompt, type docker images to list the images you currently have:
    $ docker images
        REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED    SIZE

    Find the IMAGE ID for your jepsen image.
      In this example, the id is 6dc563b59188.
      Notice that currently, the REPOSITORY shows the repo name jepsen but
      not the namespace. You need to include the namespace for Docker Hub to
      associate it with your account. The namespace is the same as your Docker
      Hub account name. You need to rename the image to
      gators/jepsen.

    Use IMAGE ID and the docker tag command to tag your jepsen image.
      The command you type looks like this:
      Docker tag command
      Of course, your account name will be your own. So, you type the command
      with your image’s ID and your account name and press RETURN.
       $ docker tag 6dc563b59188 gators/jepsen:latest

    Type the docker images command again to see your newly tagged image.
        $ docker images
        REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE

    Use the docker login command to log into the Docker Hub from the command line.
        The format for the login command is:
        docker login
        When prompted, enter your password and press enter. So, for
           example:
              $ docker login
                 Login with your Docker ID to push and pull images from Docker
                 Hub. If you don't have a Docker ID, head over to
                 https://hub.docker.com to create one.
                  Username:
                   Password:
                    Login Succeeded

    Type the docker push command to push your image to your new repository.
       $ docker push gators/jepsen:tagname (without :tagname default to latest)
            The push refers to a repository
               [gators/jepsen] (len: 1)
